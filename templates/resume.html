            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hey! I'm Jack. I am a current junior at Har-Ber High School. I
                am enrolled in several computer science classes both in and out
                of school. Through the school, I have taken Programming 1, AP
                Computer Science A, AP Computer Science Principals, as well
                Robotics I & II. Outside of school, I have earned an Intro to
                I.T. certificate and a certification in Microsoft SQL Serve &
                Database Design. I am currently enrolled in a front end web
                devolvement course and a Flutter mobile app development course.
                I have also been through the EAST program, and with the use of
                my computer science skills, I have been able to create projects
                that have helped serve the local community.
